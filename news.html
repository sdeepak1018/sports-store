<p>Last year when Australia appointed Pat Cummins as Test skipper, doubts were raised on whether a fast bowler should be given the role of captaincy. Cummins silenced naysayers with his leadership in the Ashes, which the Aussies won 4-0.
Although the conventional practice by cricket-playing nations is to appoint batters as captains, there have been many instances in the past of countries going for 'bowler captain' and consequently reaping rewards.
Pakistan have seen Imran Khan, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis successfully lead teams. Richie Benaud has done so for Australia in the yore, Courtney Walsh and Jason Holder have performed the role for West Indies, Bob Willis did it for England, Shaun Pollock for South Africa, and Daniel Vettori discharged his duties as New Zealand skipper some time back.
As far as India are concerned, there is no one bigger than Kapil Dev, who helped India corner World Cup glory in 1983. Bishan Singh Bedi also led the country for a couple of years. So when Jasprit Bumrah was recently appointed the vice-captain of the Indian T20I as well as Test teams, the question was obvious: was the 28-year-old fast bowler being earmarked for a future captaincy role?
Current skipper Rohit Sharma has no problems with a bowler being the vice-captain and he also backed Bumrah's leadership skills. "Honestly, it doesn't really matter whether it is a batter or a bowler being a vice-captain. It's the mind of the individual that matters," Rohit said.
